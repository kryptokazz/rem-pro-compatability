    <h1>Compatibility Verification</h1>
    <p>Remote Pro is designed to seamlessly integrate with a wide range of electric gates, garage door openers, and electric strikes. Acting akin to a traditional push-button, it easily connects to your existing opener via a simple two-wire setup.</p>
    <p>If you're uncertain about the compatibility of your device with Remote, or if you don't see your device listed in our compatibility checker, don't hesitate to reach out to us. You can use the contact form below or send us an email at placeholder@mail.com for assistance.</p>
    <h2>Compatibility Checker</h2>
    <p>To confirm compatibility with your gate or garage door, simply enter the model or manufacturer number of your opener in the textbox below. Our compatibility checker will then provide you with a list of compatible options. If you're unable to find your device in the compatibility checker, please feel free to contact us via the form below or email us directly at placeholder@mail.com.</p>
